# Polybugger
The goal of this project is to create a functional debugger which can debug C and C++ programs. For now, it is only limited to debugging x86 assembly code.

### Compilation instructions:
- On Linux: ```make```

### Usage
- `./debugger.e <assembly file name>`


### Note
This debugger can only step through code for now and can only debug assembly code.
